### What is AWS Amplify?<br>


AWS Amplify is a new topic for me and I want to share with you if you have not heard about it. AWS Amplify is a development framework and a web hosting service. It can help us to create mobile and web applications much easier and faster. 

AWS Amplify console is related to the open source Amplify Framework: AWS Amplify consists of an open source Amplify framework and static web hosting service, AWS amplify console. You can use these tools separately or together.<br>  

## How to Install Amplify CLI:<br>

I installed Amplify CLI on my ubuntu computer. First, you need to install updates and upgrades then in order to install Amplify CLI, you need to install NPM and Nodejs.<be>
sudo apt install npm
sudo apt install nodejs<br>

After installing nodejs and NPM you can install amplify cli by the command below.<br>
npm install -g @aws-amplify/cli

Now you can run  this command “amplify configure”. It will open aws console for you. You need to go back to your terminal and specify your AWS region and after that create an IAM user. At the end it will ask you the “accessKeyID” and “secretAccessKey” (which you can find on your IAM window). After that you can see the “Successfully set up the new user” message on your terminal and it is configured for you.
