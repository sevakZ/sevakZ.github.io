## *Machine Learning*<br><br>


This is one of the topics that I heard a lot recently but I always wanted to learn more about it and have better understanding. In this blog I will try to explain simply what is Machine learning and how it works.

### What is Machine learning?<br><br> 


Machine learning is one of the branches of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It is a data analytics technique that teaches computers to do what comes naturally to humans, learn from experience. Basically machine learning attempts to teach computers to learn, think, and act like humans. The machine learning algorithms adaptively improve their performance when the number of available learning samples  increases.

Machine learning can be very helpful for companies to make better decisions for their future big moves. These days all companies trying to get more information from their customers and competitors, with that big data, machine learning helps companies for solving many problems such as: computational finance (for credit scoring), energy production (for price and load forecasting), natural language processing (for voice recognition applications) and many other things.


### How Does Machine Learning Work?<br><br> 

machine learning algorithms analyze and identify patterns from datasets and use this information to make better predictions on new sets.

It used two types of techniques: Supervised learning and Unsupervised learning. 

SL, trains a model on known input and output data that it can predict the future outputs. 
UL, finds hidden patterns or intrinsic structures in input data. 

Sometimes we use machine learning applications even without knowing that. For example when we are calling Amazon support to return an item. The support applications solve many problems based on the data and experience that it has.  

Another example is social media, when on facebook or instagram the face recognition or people you may know features show up on your devices. Or Malware filtering and email spam are the applications that use machine learning techniques.
