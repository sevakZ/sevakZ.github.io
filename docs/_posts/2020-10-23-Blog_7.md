## *Wireless Security Protocols:*<br><br><br>

There are many types of securities and it is important to know which one we need to use for our wifi network.<br> 
Today I am going to see which wireless security protocol we should have on our wifi. We are connecting our mobile devices to wifi and doing important things such as bank transactions and transferring sensitive data. We also have many IoT devices these days that they are always on which I think we need to have better security policies for that kind of device.<br> 

The most common wireless security types are WEP, WPA, WPA2, and WPA3. the WEP is the oldest and less secure and these days nobody wants to use that one anymore. The WPA (Wi-Fi Protected Access) and WPA2 were much better than WEP.<br> 

The WPA3 is more secure than ever and like WPA2, it uses 128-bit encryption. Instead of just boosting the encryption level, the WPA3 focused on more practical ways to defend against attacks.<br> 

The WPA3 has a feature called “Simultaneous Authentication of Equals” and it focuses on properly authenticating a device to a network and using a password and MAC addresses to authenticate. With WAP3 the attackers only get one to your password each time they try to crack the code that means even weak passwords will be made much more time-consuming to crack.<br> 

The WPA3 is even much secure for the time you are connected to the public network like Starbucks wifi. For example, when we connect to a public network the WPA3 will encrypt each individual device connected to an unsecured access point to make it much harder to crack.<br> 

Lastly, WPA3 makes it very easy to connect your smart devices like your phone to your access point by just scanning a QR code.<br>
