### What We Can Do With Wireshark on Our Network?<br>


Today I am going to show you how to install and use wireshark in this Blog.
Wireshark is one of the best free tools for network packet analyzer. This is an open source software and many network administrators use it for troubleshooting and analysis for their network.
When I was reading about wireshark to see what we can do with it by having it on our network, I found out some interesting things that I want to share with you. I learned how important it is to use HTTPS for our websites, otherwise how easily hackers can find out our username and password by just running and capturing our packets over the network that use HTTP. I will show you all the process. 
First, I’m going to download and install wireshark on my Windows computer. I just follow all default settings and after installation I run it. Wireshark has a very user friendly GUI interface. On the first page I am going to select my interface which in this case is  Wifi. then I want to capture the packets, but I don't want to capture all packets so I just filter HTTP packets. 
After that I need to open a website that uses HTTP protocol and sign in with my username and password to show how wireshark will capture that. I don’t trust any website which is not using HTTPS, so because of that I am going to sign in to my router by typing the IP address on my browser.

Then I need to put my username and password.<br>

I’m going to do that then check my wireshark. I stopped capturing then right click on the IP address which is 192.168.0.100 then click on “Apply as filter”, and open “selected”. On the new window, if I open “Hypertext Transfer Protocol”, then open “Authorization”, you can see “Credentials:” which is my username(admin) and password.<br>
