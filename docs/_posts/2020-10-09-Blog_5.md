## *3 Ways AMD's Ryzen 5000 CPUs Could Dominate the Desktop (and One Way They Won't)*<br>

With the unveiling of its long-awaited 'Zen 3'-based desktop CPUs, dubbed Ryzen 5000, a charged-up AMD is firing on all cylinders (and cores) once again. Intel and its coming 'Rocket Lake'? Look out.
Back in May of this year, we published an opinion piece that detailed ***the five different ways AMD is beating Intel in the desktop CPU market.*** You might think Intel would have worked to change that narrative with some aggressive pricing maneuvering—you can't change up your chip designs on a dime, after all—but that hasn't happened. And the thing is, if AMD has anything to say about it, the chips will only continue to stack ever-higher against the silicon giant.

On Oct. 8, AMD took to its virtual event stage to ***unveil its new line of "Zen 3" CPUs.*** By the looks of them, these chips not only could extend the company's desktop domination for multi-core content-creation tasks (something its Zen 2-based chips have been doing handily for more than a year now), but they also finally challenge Intel in its last key stronghold: PC gaming, especially at the resolutions most people play at.

With so many improvements to the design, layout, and IPC made to the chips debuting in Zen 3, is AMD primed to become the default CPU choice for desktop computing leading into 2021? Let's break down everything we learned at today's event to find out, through the three key ways AMD could win it all.
The First Way: Its CCX and CCD Changes
One area that AMD has lagged behind Intel over the lifetime of the Zen brand is in gaming performance. It's no secret that in the company's push to lower the cost per core of its flagship processors (through the introduction of chiplet-based architectures), the design decisions have resulted in more latency between core complexes. That manifests itself in reduced performance in certain PC gaming scenarios--especially at the favored 1080p resolution used by most gamers.<br>

This is down to how chips are designed, and, more specifically, how they're laid out on each die. In the chiplet approach, each processor contains a series of four-core "CCXs" (short for "core complexes) that make up the larger "CCD" (core chiplet die).

When a CCD is composed of multiple CCXs (as was the case for all CPUs in the original Zen 2 stack), the added latency that comes from increased communication distances between each CCD prevents single-core, lightly threaded performance from reaching its peak potential.
