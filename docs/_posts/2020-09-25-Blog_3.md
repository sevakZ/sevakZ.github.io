## *How to Install and Set up NOOBS on Raspberry Pi*



<br><br>Raspberry Pi is a cheap, small device that lets us explore computing and install and test many useful programs on it.  
Today I am going to show you how to set up your raspberry pi from the beginning. First we need to download the operating system for raspberry pi. I have raspberry pi 3 and this version has a micro SD card. I attach to my windows computer and then go to www.raspberrypi.org/download/ . over there we have two options, download the Raspbian which is the official OS for all models or download the NOOBS (new-out-of-the-box software). I am going to download NOOBS because it includes raspbian and easier to install. I need to mention my raspberry has its own small screen if you don't have then you need to connect to screen by hdmi cable.
Extract the zip file then copy all files to the SD card then put it back in raspberry pi.
On first boot it will open a window that we can change the keyboard to ( I change it to a US keyboard). Here we have two options to install, select the Raspberry Pi OS full then press on the install button then press yes to confirm installation. 
After installation gets complete it will ask to reboot.
 Now you will see the welcome window that lets us select country and timezone. Then we can change the password ( user name is “pi” and the password “raspberry” by default). Connecting to the network and getting updates are the next steps. We also can get updates manually by opening the terminal and type “ sudo apt-get update” and upgrade by “sudo apt-get upgrade -y”.
For this raspberry I need to connect via SSH so I need to enable SSH. in order to do that we need to click on the raspberry logo on top-left corner then Preferences, Raspberry Pi Configuration. On the Interface tab I just need to click and Enable the ssh.
My raspberry pi is now ready and I want to connect to it from my main computer. If you are using windows like me, there are two ways to connect. 1- open the command prompt and type:
Ssh pi@”your Raspberry Pi IP Address”       then put your password
2- we also can download the free “Putty” software. The advantage of putty is that we can save the IP address and “connection type” which is SSH and for next time we just need to click on open.


     -	If you want to connect to the desktop of your raspberry pi remotely you can download “vnc   viewer” and put the IP address, username , and password. Keep in mind in order to connect to desktop, you have to enable vnc in raspberry pi preferences.
