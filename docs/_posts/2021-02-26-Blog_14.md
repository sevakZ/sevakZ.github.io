###Creating a NAT Gateway

This week I want to show you how you can create a NAT gateway on AWS and what is the point to have it on your AWS.

###What is NAT Gateway:

Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway allows instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services but prevent the traffic from internet connection to those instances in a private subnet.
NAT Gateway supports TCP, UDP, and ICMP protocols.

###Creating NAT Gateway:

To create a NAT Gateway you need to create VPC, Elastic IP, Subnets, EC2s, and set up routing tables and security groups.
  
First, you need to open the Amazon VPC console, then click on VPC, on the VPC Dashboard you can launch VPC Wizard.
Choose VPC with public and private subnet. On that window you need to put a name and also choose or put your Elastic IP address.
It will take about a minute to create your VPC with NAT Gateway. After that you can click on the Route table to manage your traffic route the way you want.
Do not forget that the reason you're creating the NAT Gateway to allow you private subnet access to Internet and AWS services but stay safe from outside of the Availability zone.

In this case I gave SSH access to the public network from only my IP address and HTTP from anywhere to access my web page.
For private subnet, I gave SSH access to traffic coming from my public subnet.




After creating VPC and NAT Gateway you can create two EC2s. one for private subnet and one in public subnet. I did the same and on both EC2s I installed apache2 and checked to see how people from outside can access to my web pages.
The web page on Public subnet would be available on the browser by typing the public IP address but for websites on Private subnet, it would be available only from the public subnet not outside of my VPC.<br>

This image shows that I can access to my web page in private subnet from my public subnet but I won't show up on internet browser. <br>
