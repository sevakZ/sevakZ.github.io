## *How OpenDNS Works*<br>



<br><br>If you pay off the hackers behind a ransomware attack, you could be violating US sanctions, according to the US Treasury Department. 

Before we get started on installing and configuring OpenDNS I want to simply explain how the DNS works on computers. Computers understand numbers and to communicate with each other they need to to know IP Addresses. On the other hand for humans it is much easier to remember the name rather than numbers which in this case are IP addresses. For example, to visit the CSUN website, we should remember the IP Address of the website. DNS simply solves this problem by recording all IP addresses and their websites and whenever we are typing a website, it is going to find the IP address and open it on our browser.<br> 
Today I want to show you how we can use the OpenDNS free service to protect and configure our home network from all appropriate websites on the internet.<br>

### Create a Free Account:<br>

1- Open your browser and go to www.opendns.com. Click on learn more under consumer then here we have four options, I am going to select “OpenDNS Home” and sign up.  Put my information and get a free account. <br>

2- Now we need all our computers to use the new DNS. We can do this in two ways, first go and change all computers' DNS manually for each computer or change our home’s router DNS. Of course the second way is much easier and better.<br>

3- I have a TP-link router at home, I am going to sign in to my router settings and change the DNS settings. As you can see on the screenshot below, I changed the Primary DNS and SecondaryDNS by those two new DNS servers that OpenDNS provided on their website.<br>

### Customize Our Network:<br>

After creating an account on OpenDNS we can add a network and customize with more security and filtering options. I am going to sign in with my new account and go to the dashboard, here I can click on “add a network” and give a name to it (I named it Secure). Then I can manage this new network. On the settings page, under web content filtering we can select one of the options and protect our home network from appropriate websites. As you can see on the screenshot below, I chose “Moderate” level filtering which will protect our home network against all adult-related sites and illegal activities.<br>
