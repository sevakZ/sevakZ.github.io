### What Is Amazon Cognito?<br><br> 



Amazon Cognito is a medium that provides authentication, authorization and user management for mobile and web applications. Users can directly sign-in with username and password or third party authentication such as Google, twitter,or Facebook. 

Cognito basically has three functionality; User management, Authentication, and Synchronization. 

There are two important components involved in Amazon Cognito are User Pools and Identity Pools.<br><br>  

### *User Pool*
is a directory that lets your users sign in to the applications through Amazon Cognito or third-party identity providers like Google or Facebook. All members of the user pool ( does not matter if they sign in directly or through third-party) have a directory profile that Admin can access through an SDK.

In general User Pool provides services such as sign-up and sign-in, web UI to sign in users, user profiles and directory management, and security features.

### *Identity Pool*
enables you to grant the users access to other AWS services such as Amazon S3. It also supports anonymous guest users. 

The User Pool and Identity Pool can be used separately or together but to save user profile information, your identity pool needs to be integrated with the user pool.<br><br>
