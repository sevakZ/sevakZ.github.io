## *How to replace the apache2 default index.html file with our custom file in AWS EC2 instance.*<br><br>

Hello everyone in this blog I’m going to show you how we can replace the apache2 default index.html file
with our custom file in AWS EC2 instance. This was part of our lab and it was the first time for me to 
install apache2 and change the index file on EC2 instance.

After launching your instance and opening SSH and HTTP ports and creating an IAM role and policy you need 
to go to /var/www/html directory and do “ls” to make sure you have the index.html file there.

Also open apache2 default page on a browser to make sure apache2 service is running, 
if not try “service apache2 start” or “service apache2 restart” commands.
Then type “sudo rm index.html” command to delete the file.

After delete it do “ls” to make sure that file is gone,
at this time if you refresh your browser your page won’t load.
Now I can type “sudo vim index.html” ( I am using vim editor ) and type your own text in your editor.

After creating and saving your index file you can open your browser and refresh the page to see your new text on the index.html file.
