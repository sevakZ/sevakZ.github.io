## *How to Setup a Free VPN Server in AWS*<br><br>

All internet users know that there are people out there who try to hack our systems and get our personal or business data from our computers and servers for their benefit. One of the best ways to secure our connections from our network to the internet is VPN services. We all know that but maybe we don’t like to pay a monthly subscription or we are not sure those services are really secure.<br><br>
Today I want to show how we can set up our own VPN server on AWS free for a year.<br> 
1- We need to sign in to our AWS account and click on “Services” then under “Compute” click on “EC2”.<br>
2- On the “EC2” page, scroll down and click on “Launch instance”. Over there we need to select one of the Amazon Machine Images (AMI).  Those that you can see on the window are just basic images, for today we need an image that has pre-installed applications. In order to get that, we need to go to AWS Marketplace and search “OpenVPN”. Select the “OpenVPN Access Server” and continue.<br>

3- On the next page we need to select “t2.micro” and click on “Review and Launch”<br>

4- We need to create a key pair or if you already have it, just use that one. Make sure you download that key pair before you click on “Lunch Instance”.<br>

5- Launch the Instance and when the status shows “running” then we need to right-click and hit the connect. If we scroll down we can see the example command, we need to copy it into our terminal. I am going to copy and paste it on my Powershell (make sure you use your “key”). It will ask you to configure some settings, just leave those as a default.<br><br>

6- Once you have done sun the same command but this time replace the “root” with “openvpnas”<br>
7- The first thing you need to do is set a password by your openvpn’s password <br>
Sudo passwd openvpn<br><br>
8- Go back to your running instance and copy the public IP address and put it in your browser then sign in with your OpenVPN account. Now at this point, you are done on the server-side.<br>

9-For use it on your devices you need to go to the browser and type your public IP address again but this time add “:943” at the end of your ip address (user portal) and sign in again then you can download your app based on what OS you are using.<br>
