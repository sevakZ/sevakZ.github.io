## *Network Troubleshooting Tools:* <br><br>


There are some useful tools that we can use to find out what is the problem. Here I am going to list some of those troubleshooting tools and techniques.
NSLOOKUP:
This is a simple command-line tool that is used to find out the IP address of the host that we want to check if it is available or not and also make sure our DNS server is working fine. For example if in our network someone complains that cannot open a specific website, we can open our command prompt and simply type nslookup, then we can type that website name and see the result.

As you can see the 2 lines after typing google.com are the host information and the last 2 lines give us the google IP address and information. This result will help us to know we can access google and return us the IP address too.<br> 

## PING:<br>

This is another very simple tool that we can use to check whether our website or server is available or not. We can just type “ping google.com” on our command prompt and we can see the result. It will show information like replies from the website’s with the IP address and response time. The time shows on milliseconds and it is better to have short response time. 

## IPCONFIG:<br>
 This is another windows network command-line tool that displays the TCP/IP network configuration of our computer. It will help to identify information about our computer and network like type of network adapters, IP address, subnet mask, DNS, and DHCP.
We can use switches such as /all to get more information or /release and /renew to release your IP address and get a new IP address for the moment you have issues with your DHCP.
For Linux machines we have the similar tool, “ifconfig”. This is the same tool that we can use for troubleshooting network connectivity problems.<br> 

## TRACERT (Trace Route):<br>
This is a good network diagnostic tool used to track the pathway taken by a packet on a network from source to destination. It records the time taken for each hop the packet makes during its route to destination and it will show us where we lost the packet.
