### How to Create Cloudformation Stack:<br><br>


AWS CloudFormation is a service that allows us to create and manage Amazon cloud web services resources based on a template. It lets us find the model resources for an application in JSON or YAML and we can have a collection of resources in a single unit called a slack.
You can delete or update stacks by using CLI, AWS cloudformation console or API.


Now I am going to create a new stack and run an EC2 instance on my AWS account. 
These are the steps that I am going to do:
Create AWS keypair for SSH access to EC2
Configure AWS CLI
Define stack in YAML containing EC2 instance

You can create a new directory on your terminal and then copy your keypair to that directory.
Donâ€™t forget to change the permission for your key pair.

Then you need to create a new user with admin access on IAM.

After that you can create your YAML file. I name it blog.yml and you can see all the codes that you will need to create EC2 with a security group for SSH and HTTP connections.

Now you can open your terminal and check to see if your stack will work or not. The format is:<br>

aws cloudformation create-stack -- stack-name
