## *How to use ssh key authentication for login without password*<br><br>



We can login to our remote servers and execute our commands and run our programs by using Secure Shell (SSH). It also lets us transfer files from one server to another. Here I give an example of two computers, computer A with IP address: 192.168.0.105 and computer B with IP address: 192.168.0.107.

On computer A I am going to generate SSH key pair with this command: 
 ssh-keygen -t rsa 
 
It will give us information about where this key will stored, just press enter 
Then I got the message that I already have it but I overwrote it to create a new one.
Then it will ask you to put a passphrase, you can type ot skip this part by pressing enter key.
Then you can see the verification that you successfully created the ssh key pair. If you want to make sure it is there, you can run this command.
ls -al ~/.ssh/id_*.pub<br><br>

Now itâ€™s time to upload the public key to my other computer (computer B). I can do it with this command.
 Ssh-copy-ide [remote_username]@[computer_ip address]

Then the public key will be copied into the .ssh/authorized_keys file.

After these settings I will be able to connect from my computer A to computer B without providing a password. You can run this command to check setup is working

Ssh [remote_username]@[server_ip address]
