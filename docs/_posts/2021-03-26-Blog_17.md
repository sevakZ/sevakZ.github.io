## *Amazon Route 53*<br><br>

When I was working on my project each time I was creating a web instance and wanted to check if it was working on a browser or not, I needed to copy the instanceâ€™s IP address on my browser. That was the reason to look for an AWS service to help type the web server name except the IP address which is changed each time after creating a new one. That service is Amazon Route 53.

What is Amazon Route 53?

It is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. This service lets end users to access internet applications and web servers by translating names into IP addresses. For example for our project we have a website with a public IP 52.43.120.4 and each time if someone wants to access this page they need to type the IP address but by creating Route 53, any end user can just type www.runcmd.com on the browser and access the website. The user can access the website by the same domain name that used earlier even the IP address changed.
 
What are the Route 53 features?

It lets us connect user requests to our other running infrastructure such as Amazon EC2 instances ( web servers that I mentioned earlier), Elastic Load Balancer, and Amazon S3 buckets. We can also use it to route to our other infrustructures outside of AWS.

We can use this service to configure DNS health checks to route traffic to healthy endpoints or monitor the health of our running applications.

It is easy to configure the Amazon Route 53. We can do it with the AWS Management Console or API. 

Amazon Route 53 provides 100% availability and it is very flexible that we can configure multiple traffic policies. It is cost-effective and designed to automatically scale to handle very large query volumes without any interaction with us.
