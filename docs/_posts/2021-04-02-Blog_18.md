## *AWS WAF Bot Control*<br><br>

### What is Bot?<br><br> 

More than half of Internet traffic is bots. Bot is a software application that is programmed to do certain tasks. Bots run according to their instructions without a human user needing to manually start them up every time. There are different types of bots, some wanted and some unwanted. Most of the bots are unwanted and scan your web applicationâ€™s infrastructure vulnerabilities and causes unnecessary pressure on and costs for us. 


### What is AWS WAF Bot Control?<br><br> 

AWS WAF Bot Control is integrated with AWS Web Application Firewall and let us manage settings on AWS Firewall Manger. It raises visibility of, and takes action against common bot traffic.

The way it works is first, it requests metadata such as HTTp attributes, IP address and TLS handshakes to see what is the source and purpose of a bot then it categorizes the bot types to make sure it is a wanted or unwanted type of bot.

Once it categorizes the type of the bot then you can simply use the default WAF configuration to block the traffic coming from unwanted bots. Or you can use the custom configuration to block bots based on your configuration.


## What are the Benefits of AWS WAF Bot Control:<br><br> 
 
1- It gives us free visibility into bot traffic activity.

2- It blocks unwanted bot traffic and reduces the cost of operational and infrastructure by reducing the traffic generated by scrapers, scanners,and crawlers.

3- It is easy to deploy. We can add bot protection to Application Load Balancer, AWS AppSync, Amazon CloudFront by adding as AWS managed rule group to a web access control list.


### How to Create AWS WAF:<br><br> 

It is a very simple step to create WAF on your AWS console. I am going to put some screenshots and you can follow these steps.<br><br>
