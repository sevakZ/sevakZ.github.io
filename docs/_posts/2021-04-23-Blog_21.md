Maybe you heard about Kubernetes and do not know that much about it like me. In this blog I want to share my research and understanding about Kubernetes in simple words.<br><br>

Kubernetes is a system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of applications which are containerized. This is an open-source system and it is also known as K8s.<br><br> 

Kubernetes is not the only option for IT professionals to manage their container. There are other options but it is the most popular one. Kubernetes platform was first developed by Google and later donated to Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).<br><br> 

### Kubernetes features:<br><br>

One of the features that was interesting for me is, it has the ability to automate web server provisioning according to the level of web traffic in production. Web servers can be in different data centers or on different hardware. Kubernetes based on the demand for software applications, scales up web servers and then degrades web server instances during the downtime.<br><br> 

### Kubernetes on AWS:<br><br>

Amazon makes it easy for engineers to run kubernetes in the cloud with Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS).
Kubernetes manages clusters of Amazon EC2 compute instances and runs containers on those instances with processes for deployment , scaling , and maintenance. <br><br>
