## user_data <br><br>


During this semester and also last semester when we were working on AWS and creating and running resources we created and destroyed many EC2 instances and web servers. 

Sometimes we need to create several EC2 instances and install apache on each one in order to host our web applications and doing all those steps manually on Amazon console will take a very long time. By using terraform we can save our time ro create many resources for different Availability zones and subnets.

Terraform also helps us to save our time for destroying those resources too. One of the coolest things that I learned this semester and used it many times, was user_data script. Each time you create an EC2 instance if you want to use it as a web server, you need to connect to that EC2 through ssh connection then install update, install apache2, then start the service and finally change the default web contents. But with having user_data scrip in your “aws_instance” resource, all those steps will be done during the creation process.

You can also change the index.html file and have your own text. 

In the image below you can see how I used user_data script in my projects.
