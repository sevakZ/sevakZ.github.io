## *How to Install Pi-Hole on Raspberry Pi*<br>

### What is Pi-Hole:<br><br>
Pi-Hole is a linux advertisement blocking application that we can install on our network to block all unwanted advertisements on our internet web pages. Pi-Hole functions as an internal, private DNS server for our network. Once you install and configure your Pi-Hole and computers, your websites will load normally but this time without any ads.<br><br>

### Installation:<br><br>

I am going to do this installation on my Raspberry Pi 3 from my Windows machine via SSH connection. I am using Putty for SSH and simply put username and password to get in raspberry pi.<br>
1-Once we get there we need to run this command to install the Pi-hole.<br>

2- We need to click on "ok" to confirm the software policy terms. Next step will ask us to choose our network Interface. My raspberry pi is connected to the Wifi, so I am going to choose wifi.<br>
3-  Next step, we need to select an upstream DNS Provider which I will go with recommended settings.<br>
4- By the rest of the configurations I selected the yes as default settings. Before I go to change my computer DNS settings, I want to open a website to show you the difference before and after applying Pi-Hole on your network.<br>

I opened www.yahoo.com and as you can see on the screenshot below there are big annoying ads on the top and right side of the page.<br>

5- now it is the time to change your computer DNS setting with your raspberry pi IP address.
In your windows computer go to “Network and Internet” -----> “Network Connections”  -----> right click on your network adapter  -----> “Properties”  -----> “IPv4”  -----> “Properties”  -----> “Advanced”  -----> on the “Preferred DNS server” put the raspberry Pi IP address and click on “OK” and close all windows.<br>

6- I opened the same yahoo page again and this time you can see there are no ads on the page and our Pi-hole blocked all those annoying ads from our network.<br>
